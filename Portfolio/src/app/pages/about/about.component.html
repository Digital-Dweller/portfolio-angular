      <p>Hi, I’m Alex — a software engineer with a strong foundation in networking, electronics, and full-stack development. I specialize in building practical, scalable solutions bridging the hardware and software gap.</p>
      <p>My career began with an Associate of Applied Science in Network Administration, where I gained a Linux-focused education that included packet analysis and low-level programming in C. I started my career supporting small businesses as a network and computer technician, eventually transitioning to a startup environment where I took on diverse technical and operational responsibilities, serving as the Network Administrator and Research and Development Specialist.</p>

      <p>As the Network Administrator, I implemented site-to-site VPNs and remote access solutions to bring the organization into HIPAA compliance. I enhanced Office 365 with Azure integrations, restructured SharePoint for better collaboration, and segmented the network for performance and security.</p>
      <p>As part of the R&D team, I tackled integration issues using shell scripting, USB/Bluetooth interfacing, and driver modifications. I developed processes for FCC compliance testing and eyetracking camera performance analysis, and worked closely with cross-functional teams during product releases. I also trained support and production teams, offering mentorship and creating internal workflows for technical escalation.</p>

      <p>Looking for more growth, I launched my own LLC to consult with startups and small businesses. I helped clients refine MVP designs, understand implementation challenges, and provided IT services, including Office 365 support and Level 1 cybersecurity assessments.</p>
      <p>I pursued and earned my CETa certification in electronics to deepen my knowledge of hardware systems. During this time, I completed coursework in circuit schematics, C++, LabView, and advanced mathematics such as linear equations — skills that complement my software expertise.</p>

      <p>Realizing my true passion was software engineering, I enrolled in WGU’s Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering program, which I completed in 18 months. I focused on C# and .NET development there, earning multiple industry certifications. One of my capstone projects, a .NET MAUI application, was recognized with an Excellence Award for its intuitive UI and robust performance.</p>
      <p>Currently, I’m expanding my skills through personal projects and a custom Linux test environment I built using Debian, KVM, and QEMU. This allows me to simulate deployments, test configurations, and refine code before pushing anything to production.</p>
      <p>With experience that spans systems administration, embedded development, and application design, I bring a versatile and hands-on approach to every project I take.</p>
