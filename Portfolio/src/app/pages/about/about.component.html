      <p>Hi, I'm Alex! I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in networking, electronics, and full-stack development. I specialize in building practical, scalable solutions that bridge the hardware-software gap.</p>
      <p>My journey began with an AAS in Network Administration, where I focused on Linux systems, packet analysis, and low-level C programming. I started supporting small businesses as a technician, then transitioned to a startup, where I led network administration and contributed to R&D efforts.</p>
      <p>As the Network Administrator, I implemented VPNs, Azure Active Directory, and secure cloud storage solutions to establish HIPAA compliance. In R&D, I developed USB and Bluetooth interfaces for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, led FCC compliance testing, and worked hands-on with eye-tracking technology. I also collaborated with cross-functional teams during product development, trained support staff, and created internal workflows for technical operations.</p>
      <p>Later, I launched my own LLC to consult with startups, helping refine MVP designs, troubleshooting implementation challenges, and providing IT services, including Office 365 support and cybersecurity assessments.</p>
      <p>I earned a CETa certification in electronics to deepen my hardware skills and studied circuit design, C++, and LabView. I then completed a B.S. in Software Engineering at WGU, focusing on C# and .NET. One of my .NET MAUI apps received an Excellence Award for its intuitive UI and performance.</p>
      <p>Currently, I'm exploring new technologies through personal projects and a custom Linux lab built with Debian, KVM, and QEMU. I bring a versatile, hands-on approach to every project I take on.</p>
