      <h2>Overview:</h2>
      <p>As part of my Software Engineering degree at WGU, I developed a desktop application designed to manage and modify product details for a fictional inventory management system. This project integrates user-friendly interfaces and various functionalities to facilitate the updating of product information and the management of associated parts in real time.</p>
      <h2>Key Features:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Product Search and Edit: Users can search for a product by ID or name and modify its attributes, including product name, price, inventory stock, minimum stock level, and maximum stock level. The application utilizes C# and the .NET Framework to ensure seamless handling of product data.</li>
        <li>Parts Management: The application allows users to associate parts with the product, display all available parts in a list, and manage part associations through intuitive DataGridView grids. Users can easily add or remove parts, ensuring the product details remain up-to-date. The use of Windows Forms provides a simple yet effective way to visualize and interact with product and part data.</li>
        <li>Real-Time Data Entry: The app includes input validation on fields such as inventory, price, and stock levels, ensuring data consistency. The application prompts users with textboxes and real-time updates, ensuring accurate data input and handling.</li>
        <li>Data Persistence: Modifications to product data are saved persistently, ensuring product information remains accurate and up-to-date.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>C# and .NET Framework: The application was developed using C# with the .NET Framework to build a robust desktop application that supports seamless UI interactions.</li>
        <li>Windows Forms: I utilized Windows Forms to create an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the system without needing programming knowledge.</li>
        <li>Event-Driven Programming: The application is designed around event-driven programming principles, where button clicks, text input, and grid selections trigger backend logic for real-time data handling and UI updates.</li>
        <li>DataGridView: The app uses DataGridView components to display and manipulate parts associated with products, offering a tabular view for managing multiple parts and efficiently handling data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Project Highlights:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed a functional product modification interface with search, add, delete, and save features.</li>
        <li>Created a system that integrates product details with part management, improving product configuration workflows.</li>
        <li>Applied software engineering principles to build a scalable, maintainable desktop application with user-friendly interfaces.</li>
        <li>Implemented UI components like labels, buttons, textboxes, and DataGridViews, ensuring smooth and intuitive user experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This project is an excellent demonstration of my ability to apply software engineering practices in C# and .NET to design and implement a desktop application that meets real-world requirements. It highlights my proficiency in user interface (UI) design, input validation, and working with event-driven programming to deliver efficient, maintainable software solutions.</p>
