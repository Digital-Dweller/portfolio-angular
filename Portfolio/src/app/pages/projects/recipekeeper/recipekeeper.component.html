      <p>As part of my software engineering degree, I designed and developed a cross-platform mobile and desktop application using .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) to manage and organize personal recipes. This project demonstrates my ability to deliver clean, scalable code and user-centric design within a modern software development stack.</p>
      <p>The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) recipe entries with structured metadata (ingredients, steps, tags, and notes). Key features include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data persistence via local SQLite database integration.</li>
        <li>MVVM architecture with data binding and commanding to maintain clean separation of concerns.</li>
        <li>Responsive UI for both mobile and desktop environments using XAML.</li>
        <li>Search functionality leveraging LINQ for efficient recipe lookup.</li>
        <li>Custom form validation and user input handling to ensure data integrity.</li>
        <li>Password encryption using bcrypt to securely store user credentials.</li>
        <li>Modular and reusable components designed with SOLID principles.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This project reflects my proficiency with C#, .NET, XAML, and UI/UX best practices, as well as my ability to independently scope, architect, and deliver production-ready applications. It also highlights my understanding of mobile app development, local storage solutions, and cross-platform deployment strategies.</p>
      <p>By designing this application from the ground up, I reinforced core concepts in software design patterns, agile methodologies, and test-driven development (TDD), all of which I carry into my professional engineering work.</p>
