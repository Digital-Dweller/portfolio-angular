      <p>Overview: This course management application, developed using .NET MAUI and C#, provides a robust platform for creating and managing courses, assessments, and notes. The app includes features like user-friendly dynamic UI generation, real-time validation, and seamless navigation, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. The application is designed to cater to the needs of academic institutions, instructors, and students by allowing them to track and manage course-related data efficiently.</p>
      <p>Key Features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dynamic UI Elements: Automatically adjusts the user interface based on the data provided, ensuring that each element (e.g., assessments and notes) is represented in an easy-to-use format.</li>
        <li>Assessment Management: Allows users to add, edit, and delete assessments associated with each course. Assessments can have specific dates, statuses, and types, with built-in conflict checks to prevent overlapping dates.</li>
        <li>Notes Management: Facilitates the creation, editing, and deletion of course-related notes. Notes are easily viewable and organized within the application.</li>
